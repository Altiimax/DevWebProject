# DevWeb - backup project

## General idea 
Developing a website where people can create groups/communities in which they can share specific equipment such as :
* Gardening tools
* Electrical tools
* Mechanical tools
* Construction tools
* ...

A group can be as small as a few members a family and as big as an entire city or state.
There can be two types of groupes: 
* __public groups__ : 
  Everyone can see them and ask to join them. 
* __private groups__ :
  The groups are only visible for their members. People can only join on invitation.
